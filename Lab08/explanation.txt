In method FunWithInteger(), two Integers are created and DoubleMe(Integer) is called. Since DoubleMe() doesn't
actually mutate the parameter's value outside of the function, nothing changes. 1, 1 is printed. y = DoubleMe(1) changes y to 2.
Prints 1, 2. x = DoubleMe(2) changes x to 4. Prints 4, 2. x = DoubleMe(4) changes x to 8, and prints 8, 2 for D.

In method FunWithMyInt(), two MyInt objects are created. x.DoubleMe() does modify the instance variable m_value, so 2, 1 is printed.
y.set(x.DoubleMe()) assigns the instance variable of y to the doubled value of x which is 4, as well as assigning x to its doubled value, 
printing 4, 4. x.set(y.DoubleMe(y)) sets x's value to the doubled value of y, while changing y to 8 as well, printing 8, 8.
x.set(x.DoubleMe(x)) doubles x into 16 then sets x's value to 16, printing 16, 8. y.DoubleMe() does mutate y.m_value so the
final print will be 16, 16.


Output:
A: 1, 1 // Integer
B: 1, 2 // Integer
C: 4, 2 // Integer 
D: 8, 2 // Integer
E: 2, 1 // MyInt
F: 4, 4 // MyInt
G: 8, 8 // MyInt
H: 16, 8 // MyInt
I: 16, 16 // MyInt
